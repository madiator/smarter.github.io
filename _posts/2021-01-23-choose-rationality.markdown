One of the most basic assumptions in economics is that people make rational decisions. I don't know if economists are studying people from a different planet, but the assumption of the rational actor couldn't be further from the truth. 

We humans are blessed with a three pound beautiful wetware capable of a range of remarkable things, but which, whether we like it or not, acts in funny ways a lot more than we realize. It pushes us in directions we shouldn't be going. Like a moth to a flame, we are drawn to irrational decisions that cost us time, money or relationships. We buy lottery tickets; we believe in superstitions (that we know are not true); we go on impulse buying sprees.

Speaking of lotteries, Naval's brilliant quote comes to mind:
> The lottery is a tax on people who can't do math.

But I have seen people who can do advanced math be allured to buying lottery tickets. As much as I would like to pat myself on the back for not buying lottery tickets, I am sure I have done countless number of irrational things.

A few questions come to mind:

One of the best investments you can make is to be able to think about how you think, and to use this to identify your irrationality, snip it and replace it with rational behavior.

Why does rationality matter so much?
