One of the most basic assumptions in economics is that people make rational decisions. I don't know if economists are studying people from a different planet, but the assumption of the rational actor couldn't be further from the truth. 

We humans are blessed with a three pound beautiful wetware capable of a range of remarkable things, but which, whether we like it or not, acts in funny ways a lot more than we realize. It pushes us in directions we shouldn't be going. Like a moth to a flame, we are drawn to irrational decisions that cost us time, money or relationships, and set us back in real measurable ways. We buy lottery tickets; we believe in superstitions (that we know are not true); we go on impulse buying sprees.

One of the best investments you can make is to be able to think about how you think, and to use this to identify your irrationality, snip it and replace it with rational behavior.

Why does rationality matter so much?
