Everyone knows that prevention is better than cure. Yet, when we face a problem, we often identify a cure and move on instead of understanding the source of the problem and preventing it from happening the next time.
Iceberg analysis is a concept from [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) that helps dig deeper and identify the root cause.

Only 10% of the mass of an iceberg floats above the water, and the rest hides under the water. That's the source of the analogy. Thus, according to the iceberg model of thinking, the problem we perceive is just the tip of the iceberg, and the real problem hides under the surface.

We can use the [following levels of thinking](https://ecochallenge.org/iceberg-model/) to go deeper:

**Events**: You see the events as they are, and you take stock of the situation. For example, you have stomach pain. You could certainly try to address this situation by eating pain-killing medication, but you are not addressing the root cause.

**Patterns**: What are the patterns and trends that are associated with the event happening? In the above example, this could be a pattern that you notice: whenever you don't eat on time, you seem to get stomach pain.  Aha, now we are getting somewhere. Perhaps you have ulcers in the stomach, which on its own you can address. But wait, we can dig a bit deeper.

**Systems/Structures**: What are the structures and systems in place that cause these patterns to emerge? You could have gone through medical treatment for treating ulcers, but if the structures and systems that caused it are still there, you could relapse again. One or more of the following systems could be causing the pattern to emerge:
* You tend to skip meals to work longer.
* You have deadlines one after another, causing you to work very hard.
* You haven't set up a good functioning kitchen and don't want to spend money ordering food often.

**Mental Models**: What are the deeper [mental models](/mental-models) that cause the structures to have been formed in the first place? You could believe that "career ambitions trump health" or "young equals healthy." Or you could be a very conservative spender who thinks it is imperative to save as much money as you can.

If you stop at the first level, you are merely being **reactive**. 
Getting to the second level helps you to **anticipate** the problems.
The third level of thinking allows you to modify or **design** the systems. 
Finally, when you address the mental models themselves, you can **transform** the problem.

Let's do another exercise using Iceberg analysis.

Suppose we want to address the gender gap problem, i.e., women get paid less than men for the same work.

While this is a complex problem, one pattern we could observe is that women who are mothers are affected more than other women. 

The system in place here that causes the gender gap to widen between women who become mothers and men who become fathers is that women skip work (or work less) to be the caregivers.
 
Finally, society's mental model is that "caregiving is more of a woman's duty than a man's duty."

I believe that the role of leaders is actually to work on the Structures/Systems and the Mental Models. In this case, a leader should transform the society's mental models surrounding caregiving. Changing mental models are hard, and so, designing and modifying the systems in place can significantly help as well (more on this later). For example, this will involve improving access to childcare.


## Iceberg Analysis at work
As alluded above, leadership requires thinking in levels three (designing systems) and four (transforming mental models).
If you are in a leadership role, but operating at levels one (reactive) and two (anticipating), then perhaps you are doing more of management than leadership.

Even if you are not in a leadership position, you could utilize Iceberg analysis to help inform you how to work on problems. When you run into issues with a collaborator, try to come up with the real reason why conflict is arising.  


## Iceberg Analysis for personal development
If you have read James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3GSqehL), he has two methods for changing or starting a new habit:
1. Instead of goals think in terms of systems. So instead of finishing a marathon, try to set up a system where you run 0.5 miles per day and then take it from there.
2. Change your identity. That is, become a runner instead of wanting to start to run.

While not directly related to Iceberg analysis, you can see that the third and fourth level of thinking corresponds nicely to the above two points. 
Changing your identity is akin to changing your mental models, and that's the key to transformational change.

And, once you change your mental model/identity to become a healthy person, your stomach pain will go away for a long time.
