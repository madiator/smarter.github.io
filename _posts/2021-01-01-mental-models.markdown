Mental models are effective tools for solving problems.

## Definition.
There are a variety of definitions of mental models.
A common definition states that mental models are useful tools for solving problems.


List of mental models:

### 1. Compound Effect
This is one of the most basic and very useful mental models.
The most common application of this when money compounds due to interest accumulated.
This has to be contrasted against simple interest.

This is applicable to a number of applications.
For example, when thinking about spending $10, you should realize that the true value is actually higher.
If you drink coffee for $3 every single day, you have spent $365 times 3 over a year, and that amount 
times 6 over 6 years (so comes to a total of approximately $6.6k) or that's what you think. But in reality, 
if you were investing, you would have made a lot more. So in some sense, you lost lot more than $6.6k.
Working back, the true cost of the coffee is more than $3.

You can also use this to how we acquire knowledge.  Knowledge compounds rather than grow linearly.


### 2. Flywheel effect
In Good to Great, Jim Collins describes the flywheel effect.

### 3. Arbitrage

### 4. Parkinson's law
### 5. Circle of concern

### 6. Circle of competence
### 7. Dunning Kruger
### 8. Goodhart's law
### 9. Beachhead
### 10. Pareto law
### 11. Misc
