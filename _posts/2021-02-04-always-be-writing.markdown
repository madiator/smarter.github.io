Writing is a valuable skill worth cultivating. It helps you think better and it helps you 
also share the knowledge you have with others. After all, that's what makes Internet the place it is.

---
You have a story to tell, a fact to share, or an idea that is worth broadcasting.
The medium you have to share that idea is the words you write --- and it is a lossy medium since there is always
a difference between what you want to convey and what the reader understands.
I say "always" because ideas don't exist in vaccuum; they live amongst other ideas and 
experiences, which are unique to every person.

Your goal is to reduce this loss as much as possible. And that is hard.
Being able to write clearly is a valuable skill. 
To be able to move, excite, or change someone's mind is invaluable.

Anyone can write, but writing well is hard.
Like every other skill, writing well is something that you can learn --- as long as you put in the effort.

I write because I am bad at it, and so that I can improve.

I write because I have something to say, and hope there are others who can benefit from it.

I write to refine my own ideas. 

I write to cut through the clutter in my head.

I write to experience the clarity that I get when I write. 

I write to become smarter.

Sometimes writing is a joy. But other times, I struggle to write, but that's precisely when [I am improving](/deliberate-practice).

Writing shifts from planning to action. It converts ideas to motion.

So please join me in writing. Start a blog, start a journal, or just write on that piece of scrap paper.
