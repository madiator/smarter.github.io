## What is this site about?
Let's go first with the principle of inversion, and say what this is not about. This is not about making you smarter at solving technical problems. I am not selling supplements for improving brain fog.

But it is, my hope, that reading this will help you equip with tools that can in turn help you think smarter. I hope I can help you present some useful mental models, and point to biases in thinking. I hope you can start to think rationally, to start to think about thinking by reading these newsletters.

I donâ€™t have magic powers to rewire your brain. You have to do it yourself and it is probably hard work. I am still working on myself. I am by no means smart, but I only aim to be smarter today as compared to yesterday.

## About Me
I work at Google AI and build machine learning models at my day job. \
The opinions here are my own and not of my employer.

### Why this project?
The human mind is fascinating. A monkey may look at the sky and see some stars. But when humans look at the sky, we not just see stars, but decipher our place in the universe and peer into the past.
We make things, we communicate, we reason, and we argue. The human mind is capable of endless surprises. But at the same time, we fail, often in predicable ways.
For all these reasons, the human mind is very fascinating to me.
