## What is this site about?
The human mind is fascinating. A moneky may look at the sky and see some stars. But when humans look at the sky, we not just see stars, but decipher our place in the universe and peer into the past.
We make things, we communicate, we reason, and we argue. The human mind is capable of endless surprises. But at the same time, we fail, often in predicable ways.
For all these reasons, the human mind is very fascinating to me.

With this fascination about the mind, comes a desire for me to be smarter, everyday.
For the past few years I have actually started reading and equipping myself to learn more about the human mind, what makes it work well and what makes it fail.
This blog is my attempt to share those ideas, while also learning myself along the way.
